# Churn-Analysis-Dashboard
Excited to share my latest project, Churn Analysis Dashboard, where I leveraged SQL, Power BI, Excel, Python, and Machine Learning (Random Forest Algorithm) to analyze and predict customer churn.
ðŸ”¹ Key Features & Methodologies:
âœ” Data Processing & Cleaning: Used SQL & Excel for data extraction, transformation, and handling missing values.
âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Applied Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to uncover trends in customer behavior.
âœ” Machine Learning Model: Implemented Random Forest Algorithm for churn prediction, achieving high accuracy.
âœ” Interactive Dashboard: Built a Power BI dashboard with dynamic visualizations to track churn trends, retention strategies, and customer segmentation.
âœ” Business Impact: Helped identify key churn drivers, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions for customer retention.

This project enhanced my expertise in data analytics, machine learning, and BI tools, reinforcing my passion for data-driven decision-making.

Would love to hear your thoughts! ðŸ’¡
